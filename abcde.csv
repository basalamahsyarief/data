I cant even get to the design to edit it.;Susan;Visitor;Is it the design with the photo card?;Jamie;Agent;yes;Susan;Visitor;It looks like you moved it to your cart, that is why you can't edit it anymore.

I don't think I need help at this stage yet. It's just type into your format.  I just need assurance that it will be saved this time. Also, I don't think I need the design help if I need to pay extra.;Susan;Visitor;No you won't be paying extra. you just have to make sure to save both sides of the designs;Jamie;Agent;You do not need to add it to your cart until you're sure it's finalized;Jamie;Agent;ok. again, I did save it- twice! when will the designer be able to assist me?;Susan;Visitor;could you double check to see if the design is anywhere in your system?;Susan;Visitor;"Anytime, it takes a bit longer as it's some back and forth. The best thing to do is to email your wording to support@paperlust.co
In the email, let us know that you have saved the design but it's not working properly and you would like to see a proof beforehand, say that Jamie has authorized it";Jamie;Agent;Let me check;Jamie;Agent;thanks for checking;Susan;Visitor;I will need to talk to the tech team to see if they can access the older designs too;Jamie;Agent;Would you mind if I send you an email to confirm that?;Jamie;Agent;yes you can. handash@aol.com;Susan;Visitor;Great, I have gotten in touch with them, they should reply by the end of the day;Jamie;Agent;And then i can let you know if we find anything;Jamie;Agent;ok. In the meantime, I don't think I will put the effort into a third try with the design until I hear from you.  Are you on Pacific Standard time?;Susan;Visitor

"Hi,

Sorry, I just had a question regarding my design proof. I just have one more change I'd like to make on the time of the reception, but I was hoping to get some advice on how to word it + how to fit it in on my invitation? 

Basically, I wanted to add a line notifying guests that canapes will be served at 5.30 outside the venue before the reception actually begins at 6.";Penelope;Visitor;Hello Indra, nice to talk to you again!;Penelope;Visitor;Hi Penelope;Indra;Agent;"I believe this is my very last change for my invite lol - its been quite a process! Just want to make it right :) 

But yes, about this point, I was just wondering whether I could have a look at a couple of options for this. Maybe putting ""Canapes from 5.30"" underneath the reception address in italics";Penelope;Visitor;I see, I noticed your comment on the invitation cards proof;Indra;Agent;"Yes. Or I was thinking of having the line ""Canapes from 5.30"" above the address";Penelope;Visitor;Yes, I think it's better to put it above the address;Indra;Agent;"Agent uploaded: Screen-Shot-2020-03-18-at-09.04.06.png

Size: 102910";Indra;Agent;on the green line;Indra;Agent;"with the same font type and size as ""6pm...""";Indra;Agent;Oh, the green line is above the start time and venue name. Do you mean, below that? Do in between the start time and address;Penelope;Visitor;"it's below the ""reception, dinner and dancing to follow""";Indra;Agent;"Ah ok. I was actually wondering whether I should put it underneath the reception details, just so the reception time is in the same format as the ceremony time? with the ""-"" ? 

So it'd read:

Reception, dinner and dancing to follow

6pm- Water @ Pier One
Canapes from 5.30
11 Hickson Rd, Walsh Bay, Sydney 2000";Penelope;Visitor;Or does that look silly? Sorry, just not sure with the formatting and visual aspect!;Penelope;Visitor;Or is there another way you can recommend?

11 Hickson Rd, Walsh Bay, Sydney 2000";Indra;Agent;3.60124E+11;"Ok perfect, I will do that :) Also, sorry just one more question- if I wanted to add a line about where to enter the reception (guests must enter via the venue's hotel entrance), would you suggest I add this on the Info card? I was thinking I could add this if I wanted under the ""Parking"" section, and perhaps re-name that ""Parking and Reception Details"" ?";Penelope;Visitor;Yes, sounds good, but I think our designer team will need to adjust some font size on it so the wording can fit in;Indra;Agent;Yes that's ok, I'll update it and see what they can do.;Penelope;Visitor;yup please do;Indra;Agent;we'll send the updated proof shortly;Indra;Agent;Great, thanks so much for your help again Indra - i really appreciate it!

Have a great day!";Indra;Agent;Oh Indra, sorry to bug you again! But funnily enough, I just got a call from my venue informing us that we may have to postpone! Not sure as of yet, but I think they will find out next week. Just wondering if there's anyway I can hold onto the designs until we know for sure? That way, we may be able to update the invitations with the correct date rather than printing it now if we have to postpone?;Penelope;Visitor;Sure, we understand the situation. You can let us know the updated date once you are ready, we'll hold your order until then;Indra;Agent;Ok awesome, and is there anything I have to do to ensure the designs stay on hold?

Size: 128223";Indra;Agent;"Ok great, thank you so much Indra. And in terms of the changes I needed to make regarding the entry to the reception venue, I've seen a couple of invites noting ""Please enter via hotel entrance"" on the bottom of the main invites. Is this advised, or is it better to put this line on the Information card, in your opinion?";Penelope;Visitor;based on your current proof, I prefer to put them on the invitations cards as space to add more wording is better. Your information card proof is already packed :);Indra;Agent;"Ok no worries! I will put this line maybe underneath the address?

Thats what I'm looking for. Seems like when we customize the text, it goes to all one color, but we would want the holographic multi color.;Tim Leiphart;Visitor;Yes that's correct, so in the online tool, we can't actually have the most accurate preview;Jamie;Agent;but in real life it would definitely be holographic foil;Jamie;Agent;"Sorry that was terrible grammar, so we don't have the best way to display a digital preview of the holographic foil in the online tool so it's just that standard color.

90 qty Digital print on matte $ 163.80 AUD
90 qty Digital print on Premium $ 236.70 AUD

So if you just went with the matte option, you will be saving $270 for each the RSVP and the Wishing well (the 15% discount not included)
or premium paper option (to match the main invite stock) will be $197.10 for each card (the 15% discount not included)";Jamie;Agent;Fantastic, so if i processed the order for the $1614 i would receive an approx $550 refund?;Peta;Visitor;If you went ahead with the matte, it would be approx $459 once the discount in included. The calculation i did above was for if the discount was not included across the whole order;Jamie;Agent

Size: 71742";Jamie;Agent;The one on the bottom is the Old Mill 500GSM;Jamie;Agent;the top one is the cotton 300gsm - which is the same color and texture as the double thick 600GSm (We've just ran out of stock here for me to take a photo of that);Jamie;Agent;Ahk great, yes I can see the difference. They are both quite well suited to the Black and White design I think;Penelope;Visitor;Yes they are, we can letterpress on both stocks, however we find that the old mill takes the ink better as it's softer;Jamie;Agent;17076700827;Ahh yes, that makes sense, so its more recommended to use the Old Mill?;Penelope;Visitor;Yes it is =];Jamie;Agent;For letterpress;Jamie;Agent;Ok great, thats handy to know! Might switch to the Old Mill then;Penelope;Visitor;Yes the standard stock on the letterpress option is old mill so that should be easy enough to find =];Jamie;Agent;Yes all good :) Also just one more q, can I liase with the designer on how to phrase the invites + info cards I want to order? I have customised my invites, but wanted to get a second opinion re. wording and how I've put it all together on the template before purchasing;Penelope;Visitor;Let me have a look at what you've saved;Jamie;Agent;oh sorry, not sure if Ive logged in;Penelope;Visitor;Usually the designers only arrange the alignment and spacing, we never really touch the wording provided unless there's a spelling mistake;Jamie;Agent;Ah ok, no problem. So I'll have to make sure its in the mostly final form before purchasing;Penelope;Visitor;Yes =] with wording, I found that most of our clients tend to discuss it with their family and close friend on how to phrase it, also most of our designs tend to have the most common wording;Jamie;Agent;Ye, great. I have managed to word a couple of them to our liking, however I've included extra information such as the addresses of the church and reception.. which i was hoping doesnt look too squashed on the invite;Penelope;Visitor;But I guess the designer will check that out for me?;Penelope;Visitor;Just had a look at your saved design, it looks fine. The designers will probably add kern to the text to space it out nicely and even everything out;Jamie;Agent;Remember, nothing goes to print until you approved everything in the design proof stage;Jamie;Agent;Awesome, yes that is great, but I just wanted to make sure it looks good from a 'design' standpoint haha;Penelope;Visitor;That's fine haha we will take care of all that;Jamie;Agent

Hi Guys, I was just wondering if I can order the beautiful invitations that you have on an instagram post from ten weeks ago, where you announced a new quarantine challenge for die cut stationary. I have managed to find a similar design by Shab M, but can't manage to find the colour and cuts that are shown on the post! Any help would be great!;Lauretta;Visitor;Hi Lauretta;Jamie;Agent;Unfortunately our printer we were using for the die cuts is in lockdown and won't be operating until further notice so all our die cuts are on puase for now;Jamie;Agent;As for the design;Jamie;Agent;I believe it was the medinilla range where you can find here https://paperlust.co/cascade-design/7011/wedding-invitations--digital-cards--medinilla-wedding-invitations/;Jamie;Agent;Hi Jamie,;Lauretta;Visitor;"And the other design was 'delilah"" which I believe is what you were looking at";Jamie;Agent;You just need to request the background color to be added to that design;Jamie;Agent;Thank you so much for letting me know, that is shame a shame that the operating machine is in lock down, but it is what it is! I will have a look at what i can do with the links you have sent me. I really appreciate it!;Lauretta;Visitor;No worries, thanks for understanding Lauretta =];Jamie;Agent;All good, i hope you have a lovely day!;Lauretta;Visitor;You too!

So wedding invitation on the front then the information design on the back?;Ellen;Visitor;"Absolutely. There's an option to ""create backside of design"" when you're editing the invitation and that will allow you to print information on the back";Joanna;Agent;the price should automatically adjust, but of course, blue ink on white paper is usually lower than the white ink/navy option.

The first option will require us to bring in a burnt orange paper  to print on which will cost extra whereas the section option is just a matter or changing the ink color which has no extra cost;Jamie;Agent;To go ahead with the second option, just simply request the color change in 'special request' and a designer can update that for you in the design proof;Jamie;Agent;If you prefer to go ahead with the first option of getting burnt orange paper, let me know and I can get a rough quote for you;Jamie;Agent;amazing, what would the addiitonal cost be for changing the paper?;Blair;Visitor;Could you let me know the quantities you will need?;Jamie;Agent;approx 70 invites;Blair;Visitor;Would you prefer the text color to be black or white?;Jamie;Agent;white;Blair;Visitor;Great give me a minute to calculate this;Jamie;Agent;"For 70qty Main invitation 178mm x127mm

I'm in the process of finalising the beautiful Tropical Love design for my wedding invites, and I'm wanting to choose an envelope. I chose the Forrest Green envelope for the Save the Dates, and was looking for a different colour this time.

pearl envelope has a more rough texture compared to premium envelopes";Indra;Agent;the premium envelope is our standard envelopes, so we will provide them for free the same quantities as your invites if you decide to go with it;Indra;Agent;What would you recommend? Do you think the pearl will clash with the invite and the premium would be better?;Allanah Howard-Bath;Visitor;If you wish to go with similar color as linen paper (bright white envelopes), I would recommend marshmallow envelopes, the cost will be $0.5/envelope;Indra;Agent;if you wish to go with the off-white envelopes, then the premium envelopes would be more cost-effective and you will get more textured envelopes if you go with the pearl envelopes;Indra;Agent;Would you be able to send me a photo of the marshmallow envelope?

I see you are using foil print on black colorstock paper, the printing process will take 14-15 working days after we got your design approval

"Hello, 

I received a 10% off code when I ordered my save the dates that is good for a week.  I was hoping to order my invitations within that week time period, but I still have not received my save the dates.  I just don't feel comfortable making another order until my original purchase gets here (getting nervous since it was estimated to arrive 5 days ago!)... is there any way to extend the 10% off offer for a few days until I receive my Save the Dates?";Angele;Visitor;Hi Angele;Indra;Agent;let me check your order;Indra;Agent;Thanks for waiting;Indra;Agent;your order has been shipped with this tracking number 6456829411 and you can track them on this link http://www.dhl.com.au/en/express/tracking.html;Indra;Agent;DHL has not updated the status since April 15 when the package departed from Melbourne;Angele;Visitor;"hmm we need to check this with DHL
can I have your 10% code?";Indra;Agent;When I tracked it a week ago it said estimated deliver of 4/15 and now it says estimated delivery date is unavailable;Angele;Visitor;Here is the code:  ANGELE-ZR31I;Angele;Visitor;thank you, please wait a sec;Indra;Agent;"thanks for waiting,

Thank you so much.;Angele;Visitor;"no worries :)
do you have any other concerns?";Indra;Agent;My one other question would be about getting addresses printed on the invitation envelopes.  We are using the Luna design and would go with the garamond style for the addresses.  But we would like to be a bit more formal with how we address them.  This means the names could get pretty long which doesn't work great with the spacing of this font. Are the designers able to help us with that formatting?;Angele;Visitor;It just makes me nervous that I can't see exactly what this will look like before checkout!;Angele;Visitor;Yes, we can help you with that, please leave a special request note on the customize page for this and send an email to me at indra@paperlust.co after you place the order. We'll send the envelopes design proof based on your list so you can double-check each one of them before it goes to the printing;Indra;Agent;Awesome!  Thank you;Angele;Visitor;"you're welcome
do you have any other questions?";Indra;Agent;That is all for today! Thank you so much, Indra;Angele;Visitor;;"My pleasure

"Hi,

I'm just making some changes to the design proof of my Information card in the way of text wording + additions to the text.

Is there any way to modify the fonts of the various designs?  We love the overall feel of the Garden Window design, but the fonts are a bit difficult to work with.

"Dear Shab, 

You might not remember, but you provided little thank you cards for my sisters wedding in Nov/Dec 2019 (Amanda Siriwardana). She used them as a little recipe card for a spice jar wedding favour she gave everyone with the recipe of my mum's chicken curry. It was a really fun wedding gift and my mum loved doing it so we were looking at doing the same. 

I was just wondering if you would be able to turn around 115 little thank you cards with one side saying ""Thank You, Amila & Jaleesa (with our names in Otella Font), 4.4.2020"" and the otherside having the recipe on it again which I can send you.
Our wedding is on the 4th April 2020 so there isn't heaps of time, but I thought I would check in and see.

I have a credit of $450 to use, which I was told was to be used by using the code: LOUISA450 however I am trying to order cards and when I try to enter this coupon code it says that this coupon code only applies to orders over $496? 
Could you please rectify this so that I can place my order? 

Thanks";Louisa Polglase;Visitor;Hi Louisa;Indra;Agent;let me check it for you;Indra;Agent;thank you;Louisa Polglase;Visitor;"Thanks for waiting,
I see your coupon code value is $450 and it has a term of total order minimum $496";Indra;Agent;why does it have the term of an order minimum?;Louisa Polglase;Visitor;It was a credit for $450 that I used on a previous order that I didn't use.;Louisa Polglase;Visitor;let me check this with the account team, please wait for a sec;Indra;Agent;"Thanks for waiting
it appears the coupon code generated by the system with default settings on total order minimum 10% from your coupon value
we've adjusted the coupon value manually to $405 so the total order minimum is on $450, and then we'll refund your excess payment after you place the order";Indra;Agent;thank you very much;Louisa Polglase;Visitor;"No worries, 
thanks for your feedback, the tech team is working to sort it out

Hi I am currently working on making changes to my set that I have saved in my account the BWM belly bands, information cards and RSVP cards and for some reason when i make specific changes on moving the boxed words it reverts it back to its original look prior to the change made despite me saving it.

Hi, I have one more question regarding the save the dates. Our RSVPs need to allow guests to choose from their choice of entree, main and dessert. Do you know the best way to do this or do you have any designs which allow for this?

Ideally we would have a little box next to each meal option so they could number. Can I request this in the customisation?;Karen Gardiner;Visitor;Hi Karen;Indra;Agent;yes, I would recommend the same, you will only need to add the boxes next to each options;Indra;Agent;you can simply leave a special request note for this on your customize page;Indra;Agent;so the designer team will make the proof based on that;Indra;Agent;Great - Thanks;Karen Gardiner;Visitor;no worries :);Indra;Agent;do you have any other questions or concerns I can help with?;Indra;Agent;No, that's all - thanks - have a good day;Karen Gardiner;Visitor;Oh wait, one more question - sorry;Karen Gardiner;Visitor;We are planning to complete these tonight and process tonight.

Hi, I ordered some invitations recently and was looking to order some place cards soon. Could I check how long it takes to get the place cards printed and could I get the template for providing the names? I also wanted to check want fonts I used on my invitations if possible. We had two fonts -cursive and block letters. If I could get the names of those two fonts that would be much appreciated. Is this possible?;Karen Gardiner;Visitor;Hi Karen, placecards would take 3-5 working days after approval of the design and we receive the list of names. We can definitely match the fonts to your invites as well.

The template for the names would just be an excel sheet;Joanna;Agent;Thanks;Karen Gardiner;Visitor;Could I also ask about the seating charts?

Well that narrows it down to the two for me! Im;Angela;Visitor;assuming I would just nominate a size for the cut? Being custom?;Angela;Visitor;Yes correct, there would be a theoretical maximum size - which we would need to check with production, however for around a normal menu size it would be fine, you can let us know what size you would want. If you could fill in the form here our custom team can get in touch https://paperlust.co/custom-wedding-invitations/;Alex;Agent;Perfect! Thanks will do;Angela;Visitor;are both those paper stocks available with foil print?;Angela;Visitor;Yes both of those papers can be foil stamped;Alex;Agent;Ah so it’s a physical “stamp” so not advisable to have individual guest names in foil?;Angela;Visitor;It's not possible to have variable foil on that paper type as its a different process;Alex;Agent;But you can get the names digital printed eg black or normal ink;Alex;Agent;;Angela;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Also I emailed a query about the address manager template. Only a few of my addresses require both address line 1 and 2. Should I populate the address line 1 column first for all of them? eg if there is a business name i put that in address line 1 but if no address name do i leave it blank or put the street address in that line? Hope that makes sense..;Nadia;Visitor;"Yeah, you can put the address on address 1  and if some require both address 1 & 2, you can put the additional address on address 2 column
if no address then just left them blank";Indra;Agent;we'll print the envelopes as per your address list;Indra;Agent;;Indra;;;Nadia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Hi team,  I'm interested in getting a print only job done for some invitations I've designed. It looks like most of your cards are printed 127mm x 178mm.  Is this customisable at all?;Ian Shaw;Visitor;Hi Ian, yep the size is customisable, we set 127x178 as our standard to fit a 130x190 envelope. What size were you hoping for?;Joanna;Agent;I'm still deciding on what size I want exactly. Possibly 140 square or 145x220;Ian Shaw;Visitor;Sure, well we can do those;Joanna;Agent;I believe the first option should fit a 150x150 envelope and the second may just fit in a C5 envelope;Joanna;Agent;Yes, that's exactly the envelope sizes I'm looking at.;Ian Shaw;Visitor;I see the print only option includes free white envelopes.  Would this still apply if I went with 150x150 or C5 or is that only for standard 130x190 orders?;Ian Shaw;Visitor;So for 150x150 the white envelopes would be free but standard C5 envelopes would be $1 each;Joanna;Agent;Great.;Ian Shaw;Visitor;Thanks for your assistance;Ian Shaw;Visitor;no worries :) let me know if you have any other questions;Joanna;Agent;No, thanks.  You've been great.;Ian Shaw;Visitor;;Ian Shaw;;;Ian Shaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Hi! I'm setting up my wedding website on withjoy.com using the White Garden design that matches your stationery. I just attempted to personalize a wedding sign and see that the fonts are extremely limited. Unfortunately, none of the three options matches what I've used (Pinyon Script) on my website. Is there any way the fonts could be customized as well to complete the consistent design of my wedding? Thank you!;Andrea;Visitor;Hi Andrea;Jamie;Agent;Yes we can definitely use fonts to match your website, unfortunately the online tool is a bit limited as to what it can use so we can only update it in the design proofing stage;Jamie;Agent;You will just need to add a special request in the special request box while customizing your design;Jamie;Agent;Oh ok, thanks! Just wanted to sort that out before I went ahead with the design.;Andrea;Visitor;No worries, if you wanted to tell me what fonts you want to use I can do a quick preview of it?;Jamie;Agent;"I know one of them will be the Pinyon Script (for our names); not totally sure of the other yet";Andrea;Visitor;"Agent uploaded: 1580164283498.png

I just recieved the tracking notification for my engagement invites - exciting! The only thing is it has a 10% discount for future orders and i JUST paid for our wedding invitations earlier this afternoon. If i'd recieved the confirmation of shipment earlier i ofcourse would have applied it - we only got 20 invites but they were very expensive... Is there any chance that 10% discount can be applied as a refund for the wedding stationary? It would be greatly appreciated!

Am I right in understanding there are minimum order requirements for the more premium paper types?";Sean;Visitor;Hi Sean;Alex;Agent;There are minimum order requirements for certain print types eg, foil;Alex;Agent;and paper like linen?;Sean;Visitor;does it vary by design or is it always the same?;Sean;Visitor;Yeah, linen and cotton stamp;Alex;Agent;have minimums of 50;Alex;Agent;and Double Thick;Alex;Agent;Thanks, what about raised foil?;Sean;Visitor;Minimum of 30 for raised foil;Alex;Agent;We can do down to qty 10 for the more affordable paper types for foil.;Alex;Agent;You can ask for less with minimum orders, but that is the lowest possible price due to setup costs in the printing process.;Alex;Agent;I thought so as I was looking at the Garden Estate design and I seem to be able to order it with silver foil but at a lower qty, I just can't go beyond 'Premium' for the paper.;Sean;Visitor;Yeah for cotton, linen and double thick. The 50 qty is the lowest price for that type of print type and paper.;Alex;Agent;Ok that's good to know. Invites will end up being $50 or so each if I go for the linen paper so I'll stick with premium! For Garden Estate is the min qty of 10 for  foil available on the different elements in the set (invites, menus etc.) ? Thanks;Sean;Visitor;Yep all are available in qty 10 for Premium.;Alex;Agent;that's great thanks.;Sean;Visitor;Do you think it would be clearer for our site if we just set qty 10 for the other paper types at the 50 qty price?

Thanks for checking that.;Jennifer English;Visitor;I got a bit of a fright when I got the design proof and it showed a second (but blank) side.;Jennifer English;Visitor;I see, our designer team usually send the backside in blank just to confirm that it got no wording on it and will be left blank;Indra;Agent;"Ahh, I see. That's good to know. Everything is perfect then. I can ""submit to print"".

Not a grey colour all over.;Jennifer English;Visitor;Leave the background just the colour of the paper. How do I best convey that to the printer?;Jennifer English;Visitor;yes, the backside will have the color of paper (white) but the front has a grey background as indicated on your proof;Indra;Agent;do you want to remove the grey background color on the frontside, so it has the same color on your backside?;Indra;Agent;Yes please.;Jennifer English;Visitor;sure, I'll send the updated proof, please wait a sec;Indra;Agent;They both look white on my computer, but maybe it's my monitor not showing the colours correctly.;Jennifer English;Visitor;;thanks for waiting;Indra;Agent;you can check your updated proof on this link http://feedbag.io/ru5qu10;Indra;Agent;I also include the current proof (the last image) for color comparison;Indra;Agent;Thank you.

Shall I hit ""submit""?";Jennifer English;Visitor;Yes, you can hit 'submit', I'll put the note manually;Indra;Agent;Done! Also I think it's kinda ironic that typos is spelt with an apostrophe on the final click box. Very contentious apostrophe there! Presumably used because typo is considered a contraction of typographic error, but could be misread as thinking it's an apostrophe of ownership, and that it doesn't need one to be a plural...;Jennifer English;Visitor;Anyway, something for the grammar geeks of paperlust to discuss over coffee tomorrow.

"Hi there,

I am just wondering if the back of invitation I have selected is white like previewed. It's the forest green paper.

Thanks,
Dimitee";Dimitee;Visitor;Hi Dimitee;Jamie;Agent;"So if you chose the forest green stock the whole thing will be green due to the nature of the paper, it's only ""white"" on the online tool for you to add wording in =]";Jamie;Agent;It won't be white in the final process (this will also be updated and reflect in the design proof);Jamie;Agent;Oh okay great. I am trying to imagine paper weight.. is it thicker than usual paper like cardboard?

As I think i'm running short of time;Dimitee;Visitor;So you should get the proof by within 1-2 working business days, and once you approve that it will take 3-5 working days to reach you. You can also choose to expedite the process for an extra $50 so that it will take 1 business day to get to you when you approve it by 12pm the day before;Jamie;Agent;Okay I think i'll just have to run with no sample.

"Hi There.  I am a  graphic designer who has just come across your website and it looks like a great way to get print design  and get it out there in the market place without all the hassle of everything else. Which I guess is the whole point.  I am interested in getting into this and was wondering about vector images that I have a license to use - such as water colour flowers and such that I have purchased through design websites or were given as a freebe from them. So the question is:  If I have a license to use it for commercial purposes, am I able to use it for submissions here?   Just the images we are talking about.

Can you get Blanc mode in 20 cards? As we see 50 is the minimum??;Kirsty;Visitor;let me check it for you;Indra;Agent;do you mean blanc mode design on this link? https://paperlust.co/cascade-design/9346/save-the-date--letterpress--blanc-mode-save-the-date/;Indra;Agent;it's using the letterpress print type on 300gsm cotton paper, so there is a minimum order of 50qty;Indra;Agent;Yes that is the design. Okay that’s unfortunate;Kirsty;Visitor;"you might consider checking our range of paper and print type on this link :

print type: https://paperlust.co/wedding-invitations/print-type/
paper type: https://paperlust.co/paper-types/";Indra;Agent;The paper type that are available for the custom sample print would be all digital print type with any paper stock, white ink print type with colorstock paper, metallic print type with any paper stock, and the foil on matte on premium paper only.;Indra;Agent;"Okay thank you for that. We are trying to see letter press styles from your link but have low connection. 

But this is our favourite. Do these only allow 50 min??";Kirsty;Visitor;Unfortunately yes, all the letterpress cards will have a minimum order of 50qty;Indra;Agent;and we are unable to send the custom sample print on letterpress print type at the moment;Indra;Agent;Do you still want to proceed with the custom sample print on the previous Luna save the date?;Indra;Agent;Yes we do with Luna thank you. Just checking the other styles we needs samples of at this moment;Kirsty;Visitor;I see, it will be printed with the digital print type on 300gsm matte paper as per your saved design;Indra;Agent;the designer team is working on the proof and will send the proof link shortly;Indra;Agent;Nouveau is another design we a liking;Kirsty;Visitor;Okay great thank you;Kirsty;Visitor;cool, Noveau save the date as on this link? https://paperlust.co/cascade-design/7382/save-the-date--digital-cards--nouveau-save-the-date/;Indra;Agent;do you want to get the sample for this as well?;Indra;Agent;Yes thanks;Kirsty;Visitor;sure, we'll include the noveau save the date proof on the link;Indra;Agent;but they don't include the city on its details;Indra;Agent;So on the noveau design we can not print Byron bay?;Kirsty;Visitor;yes we can, it's just the template preview didn't include that, but yeah, we'll put that below the names and put the 'invitation to follow' as well;Indra;Agent;3.60124E+11;"Okay great thank you. We also like the modern mode. 

Does the back of this invite have black and white flowers?";Kirsty;Visitor;no, they don't, as Noveau designs set don't have any floral element at all. or do you want to add the Luna floral element to the backside of your Noveau sample print?;Indra;Agent;I will need to check the cost to the account team as well, as there will be an extra cost to add the backside cards if you purchase the cards on regular order;Indra;Agent;No that’s fine thank you we thought that was in the design;Kirsty;Visitor;"no worries, 
So to conclude, we will send 2 design save the date proof of Luna and Noveau design";Indra;Agent;all printed with digital print on 300gsm matte paper;Indra;Agent;Yeah that’s correct thank you.
